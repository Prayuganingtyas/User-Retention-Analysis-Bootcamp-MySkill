### **User Retention Analysis for Retail Business**  
This project presents an in-depth analysis of user retention for a retail business using cohort-based visualization. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior based on their first purchase month and provides actionable insights to improve customer retention rates. The cohort retention heatmap was utilized to identify trends in repeat purchases over time.

#### **Key Insights and Findings**

**Cohort Retention Analysis**  
Customers were grouped by their first purchase month, enabling the tracking of retention trends across cohorts. By analyzing this data, we gained the following insights:

- Identified consistent patterns of repeat purchases or significant drop-offs over time.  
- Pinpointed specific periods where customer retention sharply declines, highlighting opportunities for intervention.  
- Compared retention performance across cohorts to evaluate the impact of marketing campaigns, product changes, or loyalty programs.

**Analysis of Influential Factors**  
We investigated the key factors influencing customer retention, such as:

- **Product Variety and Quality:** The extent to which customers are satisfied with their purchases.  
- **Pricing and Discounts:** The role of competitive pricing and promotional offers in driving repeat purchases.  
- **Customer Experience:** How well the retail experience meets customer expectations, including service quality and convenience.

#### **Strategic Recommendations**  
Based on the analysis, we propose the following strategies to boost customer retention:  

1. **Loyalty Programs:** Implement targeted loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases, especially for cohorts with declining retention rates.  
2. **Personalized Offers:** Provide tailored promotions based on customer purchase history and preferences to increase engagement.  
3. **Improved Customer Experience:** Focus on enhancing in-store and online shopping experiences to foster long-term customer satisfaction.  
4. **Regular Monitoring:** Continuously monitor retention trends and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented strategies to ensure sustained improvement.

This analysis equips the retail business with actionable insights to strengthen customer loyalty, increase repeat purchases, and drive long-term revenue growth.
