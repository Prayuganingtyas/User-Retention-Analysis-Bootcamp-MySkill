# User-Retention-Analysis-Bootcamp-MySkill
This project is the result of my learning experience during the Data Analyst Bootcamp program at Myskill, focusing on user retention analysis using Python. Using cohort analysis, I analyzed customer purchase data over a 12-month period to uncover retention patterns and derive actionable insights to improve repeat customer rates.
